 * How often the strip is told that now has moved — thirty a second.

 * This is a **redraw rate, not the clock**. Nothing is measured with it and no stamp is read off
 * it; it exists because a strip whose right edge is *now* has to be told when now has moved, and
 * during a gap in the audio there is nothing else to tell it.
 *
 * Thirty rather than the sixty it used to be, because every tick re-rasterises the visible window
 * on the main thread and the tick never stops — it runs behind the camera panel's scrim too, where
 * it was competing with a pinch for the same thread. The window crosses the screen in eight
 * seconds, about four pixels a tick at thirty; nobody's eye finds the step. Sixty was priced for a
 * screen with nothing else on it, and this screen now has a live camera.

 * stamp and the sound underneath it the same measurement — a genuinely good property, and one that
 * holds only while a single microphone runs from the first second to the last. It does not survive
 * failover. With the audio as the clock a four-second dropout is four seconds of no columns, so the
 * strip stops scrolling, elapsed stops moving, and every event after the gap is stamped four
 * seconds early: the timeline silently deletes exactly the interval it exists to record, and
 * nothing throws.
 *
 * So the clock is its own thing and the sonogram is aligned to it — the clock anchors a stretch of
 * recording, and samples place themselves within one.
