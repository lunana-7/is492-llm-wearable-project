 * drags with coordinates, a hold, a double press, the action button, the navigation swipes, the
 * Neural Band — and every one of them arrives at the data layer. What crosses into the domain is
 * the subset the session can honestly answer. A further gesture becomes a further entry here on the
 * day something above this line knows what to do with it, and not before: an entry nothing consumes
 * is a promise the screen has not made.

 * to stop: collecting registers interest, and events arrive while a session is up and holds the
 * capability. Collecting with no session running is not an error — it is simply quiet, which is the
 * honest reading of a pair of glasses nobody is wearing.
 *
 * **The stream reports events and never failures.** The capability has its own — a denied grant, a
 * closed channel, a disconnect — and every one of them is already a fact about the *session*, which
 * [GlassesSessionRepository.sessionStream] reports and the screen already draws. Surfacing them a
 * second time here would give the pill two places to learn the same news and two chances to
 * disagree about it.
