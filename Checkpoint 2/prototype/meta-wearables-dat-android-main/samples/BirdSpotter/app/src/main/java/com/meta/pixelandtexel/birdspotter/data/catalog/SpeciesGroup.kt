 * One section of the field guide — a header and the birds under it.
 *
 * The guide is browsed in checklist sequence (`Species.browseOrder`), and a reader needs landmarks
 * in 93 rows or the scroll is featureless. The sections are the landmarks: *Birds of Prey*,
 * *Woodpeckers*, *Warblers*. [name] is `Species.groupName`, carried straight from the seed rather
 * than derived here, so the editorial call about which families sit together is made once in the
 * CSV instead of twice in two languages.
