/**
 * The stratum an elevation is aimed at, named the way a birder would name it.
 *
 * **A band, not a number.** `+37°` is a fact about a phone; *canopy* is a fact about where a bird
 * would be, and it is the one a watcher can act on. It is also the reason this is five names rather
 * than a degree readout: a number would twitch at sensor rate on a screen already carrying a moving
 * sonogram, and it would never settle while a hand holds the phone.
 *
 * **It returns [GazeContext], not a label.** This is the same value the journal stores against a
 * photo or a detection, so the reading a watcher was shown while aiming is exactly the one written
 * down beside what they caught. It used to hand back a `String`, which left no way for the two to
 * be the same thing and let their vocabularies drift apart — the chip said *Horizon* where the
 * journal said *Eye level*. Turning degrees into words is
 * [com.meta.pixelandtexel.birdspotter.features.journal.JournalFormatting.gazeLabel]'s job, in one
 * place.
 *
 * The bands are **symmetric about zero, and that is the geometry rather than any one instrument's
 * habits**. Five strata, four thresholds, 35° apart: *horizon* owns the level line and the two
 * pairs either side of it are mirror images, because looking 30° up and 30° down are the same
 * distance from level whatever is doing the looking.
 *
 * **An instrument that is not aimed where it reads corrects itself before it gets here.** A phone
 * is the case that has one: it is tipped back towards the face to be read, which points its camera
 * slightly below whatever the watcher means by level, and the fix for that is a bias on the phone's
 * own readings rather than a set of bands bent to fit one way of holding one device. Something worn
 * on a face has no such offset — it points where the wearer looks — so it reports what it measures
 * and lands on these thresholds unaltered. The thresholds are the geometry; the pose belongs to
 * whatever has one.
 *
 * Any elevation is accepted, including past the poles, because it arrives as whatever the sensor
 * last computed and clamping it is this function's job rather than every caller's.

 * How high the watcher is aiming, as a stream of elevations in degrees above the horizon: `0` is

 *
 * A stream, and a live one, for the same reason [HeadingProvider] is: this says where they are
 * looking *now*. The stream itself is never recorded — where a watcher was pointing four minutes
 * ago, on its own, is not a fact worth keeping — but the reading *at a moment something happened*
 * very much is, and that is the [GazeContext] the journal stores against a photo or a detection.
 * Sampled at the moment, never replayed from a track.
 *
 * Separate from [HeadingProvider] rather than folded into it, because the two are separate
 * instruments: a compass answers a bearing and has no elevation to give, so one interface carrying
 * both would be one interface that could only ever be half-answered.
 *
 * **Never empty by way of an error.** A phone that cannot answer produces a flow that simply emits
 * nothing — the same shape as [HeadingProvider]'s silence, and for the same reason.
 *
 * The interface is the mirrored surface. The engine behind it — `SensorManager` — is the platform
 * plumbing the architecture note keeps idiomatic.
