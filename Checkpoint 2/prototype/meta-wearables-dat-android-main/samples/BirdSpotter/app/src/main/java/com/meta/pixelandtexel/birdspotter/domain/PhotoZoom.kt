/**
 * How far a photograph is magnified, and how far it has been dragged under the magnification.

 * **The whole of the lightbox's arithmetic, in a value with no view attached to it.** Pinch, pan,
 * double-tap and the settle at the end of a gesture are four ways of asking the same two questions
 * — *how big* and *how far over* — and every one of them has to answer the same rule about what is
 * allowed. Kept as a value rather than as three pieces of state on the composable because the
 * clamping is where this gets subtle, and clamping spread across four gesture callbacks is four
 * chances to get it slightly different.
 *
 * The offset is in pixels, measured from the photograph sitting centred. Positive x moves the
 * picture right, positive y moves it down — the direction a finger travels.
