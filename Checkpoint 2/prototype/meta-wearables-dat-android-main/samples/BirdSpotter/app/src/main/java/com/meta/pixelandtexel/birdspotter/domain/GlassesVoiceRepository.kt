 * action with a payload string is expressible at the SDK — and everything that arrives is answered
 * at the data layer, because Meta AI waits on an answer for each one. What crosses into the domain
 * is the subset something above this line knows what to do with, which today is the launch and
 * nothing else. An action becomes an entry here on the day a spoken command has a screen to land
 * on, and not before.

/**
 * What the wearer says to Meta AI about this app, for as long as something is listening.
 *
 * **Every event here has already been answered.** Meta AI holds each invocation open until the app
 * replies, and tells the wearer the app is not responding when no reply comes — so the
 * acknowledgement is owed the moment the invocation arrives, whatever the app goes on to do with
 * it. The data layer answers on the spot, and what reaches this stream is the acting-on half: the
 * session the wearer asked for.
 *
 * **The stream is cold, and collecting it is what opens the channel** — parity rule 4. The
 * collector is the lease: the channel to Meta AI comes up when collection starts and goes down when
 * it is cancelled, so a launch spoken while nothing collects is Meta AI's to time out. The shell
 * collects for as long as it is up, which is what makes the answer arrive whenever the app does.
 *
 * **The stream reports events and never failures.** The channel has its own — a device out of
 * reach, a message that would not send — and none of them is anything a screen can act on: the
 * launch already happened, on Meta AI's side, and the app is already open. They go to the log,
 * where a launch that was announced as unanswered can be diagnosed.
