# Bundled font licenses

BirdSpotter ships four typefaces in the app binaries. All are **SIL Open Font License 1.1**.

## What the OFL requires of us

- **Bundling in the apps is fine**, including commercially and in closed-source builds. No runtime call-home, no attribution required in the app UI.
- **Redistributing the font files requires shipping the license.** This repository is public and contains the binaries, so the full `OFL-*.txt` for each family lives in this directory. That is the obligation that actually binds.
- **No Reserved Font Names are declared** by any of the four, so the instanced static builds below keep their family names legitimately.
- The fonts may not be sold on their own. We don't.

## Where the files are

```
app/src/main/res/font/     variable files, one per family (minSdk 31)
```

 The iOS statics are generated from the upstream variable files with `fontTools.varLib.instancer`
 at named instances only, with `updateFontNames=True`. That rewrites the name table, which is why
 the PostScript names read `PublicSansRoman-Regular` rather than `PublicSans-Regular`.
